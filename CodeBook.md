## Variables
1. `subject`: ID of the participant (1â€“30).
2. `activity`: Activity performed (e.g., WALKING, SITTING).
3. Remaining columns: Mean or standard deviation measurements for signals from the accelerometer and gyroscope.

## Steps
1. Merged training and test datasets.
2. Extracted mean and standard deviation measurements.
3. Labeled the dataset with descriptive variable names.
4. Created a tidy dataset with averages for each variable, grouped by subject and activity.
